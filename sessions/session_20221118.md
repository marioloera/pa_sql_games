## Exersises solved:

1. [Using Window Functions To Get Top N per Group](https://www.codewars.com/kata/582001237a3a630ce8000a41/train/sql)
```
    WITH 
    cte_ranks as (
        SELECT
            *,
            RANK() OVER (
                PARTITION BY category_id 
                ORDER BY views desc, id
            ) as rank
        FROM posts
    )
    select
        c.id as category_id,
        category,
        cte_ranks.title,
        cte_ranks.views,
        cte_ranks.id as post_id
    from categories as c 
        left join cte_ranks
            on cte_ranks.category_id = c.id
            and cte_ranks.rank < 3
    order by category, views desc, post_id
```

1. [Calculating Running Total](https://www.codewars.com/kata/589cf45835f99b2909000115/train/sql)
 ```
    WITH cte AS (
        SELECT 
            CAST(created_at AS DATE) AS date,
            COUNT(*) AS count
        FROM posts
        GROUP BY 1
    )
    SELECT 
        date,
        count,
        CAST(
            SUM(count) OVER (ORDER BY date)
            AS INT) AS total
    FROM cte
    ORDER BY date
```
or
```
    select 
        cast(created_at as date) as date,
        count(*),
        CAST(sum(count(*)) OVER (
            ORDER BY cast(created_at as date)) AS INT
            ) AS total
    from posts
    group by date
    order by date
 ```

## Extra Exersises in postgres: Window functions with over clause
1. Avg, sum & count:
```
    WITH data (t, a) AS (
    VALUES(1, 1),
            (2, 5),
            (3, 3),
            (4, 5),
            (5, 4),
            (6, 11)
    )
    SELECT 
        t, 
        a, 
        avg(a) OVER (ORDER BY t ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING),
        sum(a) OVER (ORDER BY t ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING),
        count(*) OVER (ORDER BY t ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING)
    FROM data
    ORDER BY t
```

1. Rank over different partitions
```
    WITH data (cap, country, employees) AS (
    VALUES
            ('analyts', 'sweden', 14),
            ('analyts', 'uk', 40),
            ('analyts', 'denmakr', 5),
            ('agile', 'sweden', 3),
            ('agile', 'uk', 110),
            ('agile', 'denmakr', 55)
        
    )
    SELECT 
        cap, country, employees,
        rank() over (partition by country order by employees desc) as most_employes_per_cap_rank,
        rank() over (partition by cap order by employees desc) as most_employes_per_cap_rank,
        rank() over (order by employees desc) as total_rank,
        row_number() over () as row_number

    FROM data
    ORDER BY cap, employees desc
```
